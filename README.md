Pretty straight forward addon. CursorGlow will add a animation whenever you move your cursor so that it stands out when you are having a hard time finding it in PVP, a Raid, and or Dungeons. You can enable the addon to only work while you are in combat. You can enable it to be active at all times. Or you can disable it. Choice is yours.

 

Colors are:

red 
green 
blue 
purple 
white 
pink 
orange 
cyan 
yellow 
gray 
gold 
teal 
magenta 
lime 
olive 
navy 

 

Animations:

9 different ring types

4 different star types

1 Starburst

Alliance Icon

Horde Icon 

2 Swirls

3 Butterflies (for the ladies, or whomever likes butterflies)


 Class Colors:
Will be the color according to your class. First time using the addon it will be the color of your class. If you change the color in options it will remain that color unless you change it again. Class color only works on the first time using the addon. If you don't change the color, it will stay your class color.

 

You can now change the affect between 22 different animations. You can change colors. You can also change the min/max size of the effect as well as the Opacity. I have also added an option to enable/disable the addon.

 

You can change the color to whatever you feel you need. It will save the color you have chosen on a /reload or a logout/login.
